// The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure. This is known as a one-dimensional array, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Notice it contains booleans, strings, and numbers, among other valid JavaScript data types:

// let simpleArray = ['one', 2, 'three', true, false, undefined, null];
// console.log(simpleArray.length);
// The console.log call displays 7.

// We have defined a variable called yourArray. Complete the statement by assigning an array of at least 5 elements in length to the yourArray variable. Your array should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.

let yourArray = [2,4,6,8,10,true,"even number"];
console.log(yourArray.length);
